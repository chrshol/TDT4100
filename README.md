# OOP Prject for TDT4100 at NTNU

The goal of this project was to get familier with object oriented programming using Java. We worked in pairs of two and we were free to choose whater project we wanted. My teammate and I landed on making a Hotel Booking App. This project was my first team coding project, and gave me the opportunity to learn pair programming and gain experience with using Git.


In this project me and my partner developed a functional app consisting of several classes. We ensured that all classes encapsulate tehir state and include validation when state changes occur. The user interface was created using FXML, supported by Controller and App classes. Additionally, the app features the ability to read from and write to a file, making it useful for storing data such as a list of all bookings. Appropriate error handling was implemented throughout the app, and we created a set of JUnit tests to verify that the app's functionality works as intended

## How to run the code

To run the app, please run the file HotelBookingApp.java in the scr/main/java/prosjekt folder


## How to use the app

You must always start the app by loading in previous bookings by clicking "load" button, type in your booking information and then click on the room you want. Then click on "Check available rooms" button and ypu booking will be confirmed if the room is available. Your booking will then appear in the "Bookings overview" folder. Remember to click "Save" before leaving the app. To cancel a reservation, simply choose the booking you want to cancel in the "Bookings overview" folder and then press "Cancel reservation", them save.
